@title{Claim 2: Did SARS-CoV-2 Begin From an Infected Lab Worker or Animal in Wuhan?}

We will begin this claim by first acknowledging that, obviously, the answer to this question remains unknown as of now. However, it is appropriate to collect and highlight all evidence that may support this theory, and evidence that may disprove it.

In Claim 1, we proved that it is highly probable that SARS-CoV-2 could have been present in the WIV or the WHCDC - either as samples in a lab, or in live animals held in cages. In either situation, a single accident could result in exposure ("Laboratory-Acquired Infection") to a human being that would become Patient Zero of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we will provide evidence that such accidental exposure is also highly probable.

@section{Hypothetical Spillover Events}

    We claim that a spillover event involving these labs could have occured in one of several ways:

    @itemize[
        @item{A researcher working in a BSL-2, BSL-3, or BSL-4 lab could have been exposed to the pathogen while performing an experiment. Because SARS-CoV-2 has an incubation period between several days and several weeks, and because infected people can spread it asymptomatically, a researcher who is infected would not know they are infected until symptoms appear, possibly hundreds of hours later. This is sufficient time for them to spread the virus to others if they do not self quarantine.}
        @item{Lab animals involved in experiments could have been improperly disposed of or even illegally sold to markets. Whoever comes into contact with infected tissue would be at risk of infection, for example if they touch the animal and then touch their face, or even eat the animal.}
        @item{An infected lab animal could have bitten or otherwise exposed a researcher to SARS-CoV-2, and they could either have not quarantined at all or quarantined for too little time (i.e. they would still be contagious past the quarantine period).}
    ]

    We will prove in this claim that evidence exists to support all three possibilities.

        "https://archive.is/tNCX5"]{

        Two years before the novel coronavirus pandemic upended the world, U.S. Embassy officials visited a Chinese research facility in the city of Wuhan several times and @bold{sent two official warnings back to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab, which was conducting risky studies on coronaviruses from bats}. The cables have fueled discussions inside the U.S. government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus — even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge.

        In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which had in 2015 become China’s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). WIV issued a news release in English about the last of these visits, which occurred on March 27, 2018. The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss, the consul general in Wuhan, and Rick Switzer, the embassy’s counselor of environment, science, technology and health. @bold{Last week, WIV erased that statement from its website, though it remains archived on the Internet.}

        ...

        “During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,” states the Jan. 19, 2018, cable, which was drafted by two officials from the embassy’s environment, science and health sections who met with the WIV scientists. (The State Department declined to comment on this and other details of the story.)

        ...

        As many have pointed out, there is no evidence that the virus now plaguing the world was engineered; scientists largely agree it came from animals. @bold{But that is not the same as saying it didn’t come from the lab, which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals}, said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley.

        ...

        Sources familiar with the cables said they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns at the WIV lab, especially regarding its work with bat coronaviruses. The embassy officials were calling for more U.S. attention to this lab and more support for it, to help it fix its problems.

        ...

        @bold{No extra assistance to the labs was provided by the U.S. government in response to these cables}. The cables began to circulate again inside the administration over the past two months as officials debated whether the lab could be the origin of the pandemic and what the implications would be for the U.S. pandemic response and relations with China.

        ...

        @bold{“The idea that it was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial. The evidence it leaked from the lab is circumstantial. Right now, the ledger on the side of it leaking from the lab is packed with bullet points and there’s almost nothing on the other side,” the official said.}

        ...

        The origin story is not just about blame. It’s crucial to understanding how the novel coronavirus pandemic started because that informs how to prevent the next one. The Chinese government must be transparent and answer the questions about the Wuhan labs because they are vital to our scientific understanding of the virus, said Xiao.

        We don’t know whether the novel coronavirus originated in the Wuhan lab, but the cable pointed to the danger there and increases the impetus to find out, he said.

@section[#:tag "post-guidelines"]{Post-Outbreak Biosafety Guidelines}

    Following the outbreak, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology ordered new biosafety rules: 

    @snippet[
        "Biosafety guideline issued to fix chronic management loopholes at virus labs"
        "February 17, 2020"
        "http://www.ecns.cn/news/sci-tech/2020-02-17/detail-ifztrmvi9821649.shtml"
        "https://archive.is/wip/w2d3o"]{

        The Ministry of Science and Technology issued new rules over the weekend, requiring laboratories nationwide to boost their biosafety in a move that  experts said could fix chronic inadequate management issues during the campaign against the coronavirus. 

        The guideline stressed the importance of strengthening the management of bio labs, especially on viruses, to ensure biosafety, ministry official Wu Yuanbin said at a press conference on Saturday.

        The release of the guideline deals with chronic loopholes at laboratories, Yang Zhanqiu, a deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University in Hubei Province, told the Global Times on Sunday. 

        "The mention of biosafety at labs by the ministry has nothing to do with some saying that the coronavirus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences," Yang said. 

        Laboratories in China have paid insufficient attention to biological disposal, Yang said. 

        Lab trash can contain man-made viruses, bacteria or microbes with a potentially deadly impact on human beings, animals or plants.
    }

    A well-meaning explanation would be that this move was done to prevent the escape of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses from a laboratory (as SARS-CoV-1 escaped back in 2004, which was an international embarrassment for China).

    A less charitable explanation was that this move was done to prevent the escape of SARS-CoV-2 from a laboratory, again.

    It is notable that Yang Zhanqiu pushed back against the WIV outbreak theory, but did not address the WHCDC theory as outlined in the @seclink["whcdc"]{Botao Xiao paper}.

    This all being said, these changes also reduces the probability of another lab based outbreak in the future, so we wholeheartedly support them, and we are always happy to see these hazards addressed.

@section[#:tag "animal-seller"]{Arrest of Lab Animal Seller}

    From the same ECNS article in the previous section:

    @centered{
        Medical staff and experts have long been asking for better regulation and supervision of biological research institutes in China, but with mixed results. 

        A top academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering earned 10.17 million yuan ($1.46 million) by @bold{illegally selling off lab animals} and experimental milk, according to a report in the Shanghai-based The Paper. 

        Li Ning, a leading expert at transgenic technologies at China Agricultural University, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on January 2 for grafting 37.56 million yuan.

    The academician's arrest shows that the regulations concerning lab safety were either too lacking or not properly enforced and enable a bad actor to put many others in danger for their own profit. The new biosafety rules were likely put in place to rectify these deficiencies.

    If a "top academician" was selling lab animals at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, could a worker at the WIV or WHCDC have been doing the same thing? Why not?

    Could one of these lab animals have been sold to the Huanan Seafood Market?

@section[#:tag "huang-disappearance"]{Disappearance of Huang Yanling}

    In early January, Chinese social media was abuzz with a huge claim: Huang Yanling, a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was Patient Zero. This prompted WIV to issue a statement ("中国科学院武汉病毒研究所声明") refuting the claims directly:

        Unreliable information has been circulating on the Internet recently, saying that our graduate Huang Yanling is the so-called "patient zero" who was the first to be infected with the new coronavirus. After verification, our firm solemnly declares as follows:

    Furthermore, in early February, the Chinese Communist Party officially reprimanded Wuhan officials:

        The political fallout from the outbreak also escalated on Thursday with the firing of party chief of Hubei province, the party chief of Wuhan and the head of China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office. Ying Yong, the new party chief of Hubei, came up through the ranks in Zhejiang, where the president, Xi Jinping, previously served as party secretary and was also part of anti-corruption campaigns, the president’s signature initiative.

    Curiously, the lab that first shared the genome has also been closed for "rectification", apparently because it shared it without prior authorization:

        "https://archive.is/vSHl1"]{

        The laboratory at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre was ordered to close for “rectification” on January 12, a day after Professor Zhang Yongzhen’s team published the genome sequence on open platforms. It closed temporarily the following day.

        ...

        “The centre was not given any specific reasons why the laboratory was closed for rectification. [We have submitted] four reports [asking for permission] to reopen but we have not received any replies,” a source with the centre said, requesting anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.

        ...

        It was not clear whether the closure was related to the publishing of the sequencing data before the authorities.

        ...

        China’s National Health Commission announced hours after the release by Zhang’s team that it would share the genome sequence with the World Health Organisation. It later emerged that the information had been sent through the officially designated Wuhan Institute of Virology.

        Zhang’s team isolated and finished the genome sequence of the then-unknown virus on January 5, two days before China’s official announcement that mysterious pneumonia cases in Wuhan were caused by a hitherto unknown coronavirus.

        ...

        The Shanghai centre reported its discovery to the National Health Commission on the same day and recommended “relevant prevention and control measures” be taken in public places, because the patient from whom the sample was collected had suffered very severe symptoms and the virus resembled a group previously found in bats.

        @bold{The team made the finding public on January 11 after it saw that the authorities had taken no obvious action to warn the public about the coronavirus.}
    }

   

    @subsubsub*section[#:tag "wuhan-conclusion"]{Conclusion}

        To summarize, Wuhan officials:

        @itemize[
            @item{Censored local medical professionals who attempted to sound the alarm on a new outbreak.}
            @item{Ordered local labs to destroy samples of the virus.}
            @item{Withheld the SARS-CoV-2 genome until Xi's involvement.}
            @item{Continually insisted on no human-to-human transmission. Experts sent from Beijing confirmed it in one day.}
            @item{Pretended that everything was normal, still holding a massive 40,000 family banquet despite the clear risk of further transmission.}
        ]

        Containment measures only became widespread after Xi's involvement. Which leads to the question: 

        Why were Wuhan officials trying so hard to hide the outbreak? Why did they continue to deny obvious facts until the federal government intervened, and their lies fell apart?

        Suppose the outbreak was completely natural and Wuhan officials were not aware of its spillover event. Why would they act so guilty?

        Now, suppose Wuhan officials were notified of a lab accident prior to the beginning of the outbreak. Do their actions make more sense, in the context of an employee trying to hide a huge mistake from his or her boss?

    @subsubsub*section{Alternative Theory: Puppet Government}

    One alternative theory has been that the federal government was well aware of the outbreak, and opted to fire Wuhan officials after containment measures failed, to show the people that they were actively responding to the crisis. This is the theory asserted by the Guardian article. 

    However, given the timeline, we believe China's actions after Xi's involvement were a late over-reaction to counteract an initial under-reaction. It is clear that Wuhan officials were banking their jobs on being able to contain the outbreak before it spread elsewhere.

    Above all, regardless of whether the federal government was involved in the initial cover-up, the fact there was a cover-up at all hints that powerful government figures were trying to hide uncomfortable truths. Is it not likely that one such truth might be the true nature of the outbreak?

@section[#:tag "notice-3"]{Notice No.3}

    The Journalist, a subsidiary of Storm Media (a Taiwanese news company), reports that it has obtained the official Wuhan government notice ordering the destruction of virus samples and blocking the reporting of results.

        As early as the end of December last year, at least nine cases of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan have been sequenced and shown to be "SARS-like coronavirus", but it was issued on January 3 by the China National Health Commission (National Health and Health Commission). The Circular No. 3 requires the destruction of the existing samples, and also orders not to disclose the information without authorization, thus missing the prime time for epidemic prevention.

        ...

        One of the official documents of the Communist Party obtained by "New News" is the heavy red-headed document "No. 3 Document" issued by the National Health and Health Commission on January 3. This full name "Notice on Strengthening the Management of Biological Sample Resources and Related Scientific Research Activities in the Prevention and Control of Major Emergent Infectious Diseases" was not published on the official website of the National Health and Health Commission.

        @image[#:scale 0.5]{assets/notice-no3.png}

        ...

        There are several important regulations in the No. 3 document obtained from this journal:

        1. Relevant institutions shall provide biological samples to designated pathogen testing institutions to carry out etiological [epidemiological] testing and complete the handover procedures in accordance with the requirements of the health administrative departments above the provincial level.

        2. Without approval, it is not allowed to provide biological samples @bold{and related information} to other institutions and individuals.

        3. Institutions and individuals who have obtained biological samples of relevant cases from the relevant medical and health institutions shall immediately destroy the samples on site or send them to the depository institutions designated by the state for safekeeping.

        4. During the epidemic prevention and control work, @bold{no organization or individual may publish information about pathogen detection or experimental activities without authorization.}

        ...

        In addition, according to the Caixin.com report, from December 30th, the Chinese Academy of Sciences took the virus samples and put them into the library, to carry out the virus isolation, complete the virus gene sequencing, and isolate the virus strain. "Viral pneumonia" was renamed to "new coronavirus-infected pneumonia", and the viral genome sequence was announced. However, 15 days have passed since the first case of gene sequencing confirmed the new coronavirus on December 27, and the viral genome sequence was released to the public on January 11. The days from the end of December 2019 to the beginning of January this year were supposed to be the crucial moments that determine the fate of countless people, but at that time, the public did not even know the virus.

        ...

        After the National Health and Health Commission issued the No. 3 document, the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was required to stop pathogen detection, destroy existing samples and destroy existing samples. 

        Page translated to English via Google Translate.
    }

    Regulating the potentially unsafe transport of virus samples is fair enough. But there is no charitable explanation for why "information about pathogen detection or experimental activities" needs authorization to be released (these are scientists performing this research, after all) or why the WIV, supposedly the safest and most advanced bio-laboratory in China, was ordered to cease its work and destroy its samples as well at such a crucial time during the outbreak. Regardless of your opinion on the WIV, they most certainly had the capacity to perform medical research that could have aided the global community if they had been allowed to continue performing it.

    On the other hand, ordering the WIV to destroy all samples and disassociate itself with the virus makes complete sense if you are trying to invalidate lab outbreak rumors before they become prominent. One cannot easily confirm the presence of a sample in a lab after it has been destroyed. Unfortunately for the publishers of Notice No. 3, it appears that these rumors went viral anyways.

    @subsection{Conclusion}

       It is understandable that China may think an inquiry led by the United States or Australia may be political and not scientific in nature. What is less understandable is why they would deny the World Health Organization - which is not affiliated with any single nation state and in fact has lost all financial ties to the U.S. after President Trump cancelled its funding - or the European Union, which has not yet officially accepted the lab outbreak theory. The last article even points out that "Macron’s office has dismissed US claims that the virus could have come from a virology lab in Wuhan" - so, what harm could there be in allowing independent sources to confirm the origin of SARS-CoV-2?

       Recall that, upon its opening, the WIV was referred to as a @seclink["wiv"]{"World Health Organization ‘reference laboratory’ linked to similar labs around the world"} and @seclink["wiv"]{"a key node in the global biosafety-lab network"}. Now that a pandemic has occured and its cooperation is paramount, China is refusing to allow even the WHO to enter.

       That China covered up the early days of its outbreak is widely accepted among the public by this point, but what is less known is if China is also covering up the origin of the outbreak as well. Refusing to allow independent investigations and threatening boycotts for countries that try are generally not regarded as innocent actions.
