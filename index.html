prove that (1) the SARS-CoV-2 virus was present at a biolaboratory in Wuhan, China, and (2) the SARS-CoV-2 virus was introduced into the greater Wuhan population by an infected lab worker or animal. These claims from this point on will be referred to as <span style="font-weight: bold">Claim 1</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">Claim 2</span>.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">This document does not attempt to provide a concrete conclusion on whether either claim is factually true. Rather, it examines the probability that each claim is true to allow the reader to make his or her own conclusions</span>. While either claim cannot be irrevocably proven true, an attempt has been made to ensure the evidence used to support these claims is as factual as possible.</p><p>Furthermore, this document does not attempt to investigate claims that SARS-CoV-2 is a "man-made bioweapon" or whether its release was intentional.

We would like to investigate all theories that could explain the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 without predefined assumptions on what can or can not be true.</p><h4>6.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.If_.We_re_.Right)"></a>If We&rsquo;re Right</h4><p>We believe in holding the Chinese government accountable for changes in regulations and policies that can prevent another laboratory accident. In particular, we would like to see a nationally unified movement toward transparency so that the world may rest assured in the belief that China will not hide the next pandemic, natural or otherwise, if it occurs under their jurisdiction. It is vitally important that lab safety is taken seriously in all countries to ensure the survival and continued success of the human race.</p><p>We do not believe in holding individual lab technicians or employees accountable unless they have demonstrated criminal negligence. In most accidents, procedures and policies are the culprit, not individual people. Punishing one person will not prevent the next person from making the same mistakes; instituting new rules that prevent such mistakes will.</p><h4>6.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.If_.We_re_.Wrong)"></a>If We&rsquo;re Wrong</h4><p>If our claims are proven false, the next step is to determine the true origin of the outbreak, assuming the evidence that proved our claims false did not do that already.</p><p>We believe in holding every government accountable for changes in regulations and policies that can prevent another natural outbreak. Whether these be new food safety standards, stronger enforcement of wildlife trade, mandatory reporting rules or agricultural inspections, we want to see the root cause of the problem addressed so that it may never occur again. COVID-19, lab accident or otherwise, has unleashed incalculable pain upon our world, and we must ensure the conditions that enabled its emergence are left behind to history.</p><h4>6.3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Either_.Way)"></a>Either Way</h4><p>We condemn racist attacks on Asian Americans and Asians, including Chinese people, around the world. They are all innocent.</p><p>A secondary goal of this document is to further spread global awareness of the hazards posed by biolaboratories, in particular gain-of-function studies, and proximal location to urban areas.</p><p>The American CDC, for example, is a 15 minute drive away from Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson Airport, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic">"world&rsquo;s busiest airport every year since 2000."</a>. It, too, houses BSL-4 labs that do work on Ebola, smallpox, and anthrax viruses. We must ensure our leaders and representatives are aware of these hazards and are continuing to take steps, in every country, to nullify the possibility of an outbreak.</p><p>We do not believe in the eradication of critical virus research; we simply ask that due dilligence is applied transparently wherever it is performed.</p><h3>7<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Nomenclature)"></a>Nomenclature</h3><p>Throughout this document we may use several uncommon phrases or acronyms.

What we will question is whether this spillover event occured at a market in Wuhan, at a biolaboratory in Wuhan, as a result of interacting with a lab animal from one of these biolaboratories, or somewhere else entirely.</p><h3>8<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Claim_1__.Was_.S.A.R.S-.Co.V-2_.Present_.At_.A_.Bio-.Laboratory_in_.Wuhan__.China_)"></a>Claim 1: Was SARS-CoV-2 Present At A Bio-Laboratory in Wuhan, China?</h3><p>At this time, it is widely believed that Patient Zero was infected in Wuhan, China with SARS-CoV-2. What is not so certain is where exactly in Wuhan Patient Zero was infected, and how he/she was infected. The competing theories are:</p><ul><li><p>From eating wild animals at the Huanan Seafood Market</p></li><li><p>From doing work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which performed gain-of-function research on the original SARS virus</p></li><li><p>From doing work at the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control, which performed experiments on and housed many bats known for carrying coronaviruses</p></li><li><p>From somewhere elsewhere entirely; they were not in Wuhan at all</p></li></ul><p>Patient Zero would then go on to spread the infection, likely asymptomatically, to many people before any defensive measures were taken. This would eventually cause the pandemic now known as COVID-19 and resulting worldwide lockdown.</p><h4>8.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._market)"></a>The Huanan Seafood Market</h4><p>The seafood market gained prominence after a study in the New England Journal of Medicine referred to it as a possible origin point:</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 (January 24, 2020)</span></p><p>Four lower respiratory tract samples, including bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, were collected from patients with pneumonia of unknown cause who were identified in Wuhan on December 21, 2019, or later and who had been present at the Huanan Seafood Market close to the time of their clinical presentation.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001017"><span class="url">https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001017</span></a> (<a href="https://archive.is/K1HBk">archived</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, as SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV-1 are zoonotic viruses (meaning they spread from animals to humans), it is possible someone may have been in close proximity or even eaten an animal containing the virus. This would constitute a spillover event, many of which have occured in the past and resulted in the introduction of new diseases to humanity. So, it is not unprecedented.</p><p>However, a later paper from The Lancet reported that many initial patients were not actually exposed to the Huanan Seafood Market in any way:</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (January 24, 2020)</span></p><p>27 (66%) patients had direct exposure to Huanan seafood market (figure 1B). Market exposure was similar between the patients with ICU care (nine [69%]) and those with non-ICU care (18 [64%]). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. The first fatal case, who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a 7-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days after illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext"><span class="url">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext</span></a> (<a href="https://archive.is/fuU3W">archived</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Because 34% of cases did not have exposure to the market yet were exposed to the virus, it is highly unlikely the market is the origin point of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, the study confirms "<span style="font-weight: bold">No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases</span>" - meaning that the first patient at the market was not responsible for spreading the virus to other cases.</p><p>What is clear is that the spread of the virus began to rise exponentially after it arrived at the Huanan Seafood Market. According to the Wall Street Journal quoting the Chinese Center for Disease Control, the virus was present in "environmental samples" at the market:</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Virus Sparks Soul-Searching Over China&#8217;s Wild Animal Trade (January 26, 2020)</span></p><p>Health officials took specimens from the site and found evidence of the virus in 33 out of 585 samples, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, or CCDC.
The virus had been found not just in people&#8217;s bodies, but on wild-meat stalls, Gao Fu, the CCDC director told Chinese state television on Thursday. &#8220;We must thus call on everyone not to eat wild animals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is only a matter of time to find out which is the specific animal.&#8221;</p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/virus-sparks-soul-searching-over-chinas-wild-animal-trade-11580055290"><span class="url">https://www.wsj.com/articles/virus-sparks-soul-searching-over-chinas-wild-animal-trade-11580055290</span></a> (<a href="http://archive.is/ceGON">archived</a>)</p></blockquote><p>While Mr. Fu here seems to believe the virus originated from the market, we know from the Lancet study that it is unlikely. So, if SARS-CoV-2 did not originate at the market itself, where could it have come from?</p><h4>8.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._sus)"></a>Suspected Laboratories</h4><p>The first calls to examine the laboratories began when it emerged that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, China&rsquo;s only BSL-4 bio-laboratory, was only 8.6 miles away from the seafood market. Additionally, the Wuhan Centre for Disease Prevention &amp; Control is located a mere 2.6 miles away. We can easily confirm this with Google Maps:</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Directions from Huanan Seafood Market to Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS</span>

In Claim 2 we will prove it is entirely possible, and even likely, that an accident at either of these labs could have resulted in Patient Zero.</p><p>For now, let us prove that both of these labs have conducted experiments on the SARS-CoV-1 virus, <span style="font-style: italic">some of which have resulted in variants of the virus</span>, and may still be holding such viruses today. Furthermore, we will prove both labs have conducted experiments involving SARS-CoV-1 on live animals.

The WHCDC also operates BSL-2 labs. What does this mean?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level">The Bio-Safety Level (BSL), also known as the Pathogen or Prevention level (P) in the European Union, dictates the regulations and requirements present in a bio-laboratory</a>. These precautions are necessary to prevent harm to employees, the people who interact with them, and life as a whole. The BSL of a given laboratory, at least in the United States, limits the type of pathogens it can operate with. For example, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/facing-down-the-world-s-deadliest-pathogens-in-a-bsl4-lab/">Ebola, smallpox, and plague</a> can only be present in BSL-4 environments due to their potential to cause harm.

SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs share identical genome organizations and high sequence identities, with the main exception of the N terminus of the spike protein (S), known to be responsible for receptor binding in CoVs. In this study, we investigated the receptor usage of the SL-CoV S by combining a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudovirus system with cell lines expressing the ACE2 molecules of human, civet, or horseshoe bat. In addition to full-length S of SL-CoV and SARS-CoV, a series of S chimeras was constructed by inserting different sequences of the SARS-CoV S into the SL-CoV S backbone. Several important observations were made from this study. First, the SL-CoV S was unable to use any of the three ACE2 molecules as its receptor. Second, the SARS-CoV S failed to enter cells expressing the bat ACE2. Third, the chimeric S covering the previously defined receptor-binding domain gained its ability to enter cells via human ACE2, albeit with different efficiencies for different constructs. Fourth, a minimal insert region (amino acids 310 to 518) was found to be sufficient to convert the SL-CoV S from non-ACE2 binding to human ACE2 binding, indicating that the SL-CoV S is largely compatible with SARS-CoV S protein both in structure and in function.

The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26552008"><span class="url">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26552008</span></a> (<a href="https://archive.is/RrK4A">archived</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Three important definitions to understand this in layman&rsquo;s terms:</p><ul><li><p>"in vitro" means an experiment using cells (i.e. petri dishes and test tubes)</p></li><li><p>"in vivo" means an experiment using real, living organisms (i.e. mice)</p></li><li><p>"chimera virus" means it is a genetic mixture of two separate viruses</p></li></ul><p>Once again, in layman&rsquo;s terms:</p><ul><li><p>We found a virus in bats called SHC014-CoV that is similar to SARS.</p></li><li><p>We constructed a chimera virus using SHC014-CoV as a basis that could also infect mice cells.</p></li><li><p>We found the same virus can infect "human airway cells" and impact them the same way as "epidemic strains of SARS-CoV" in vitro.

It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it passed onto human. An article published on The Lancet reported that 27 of 41 infected patients were found to have contact with the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.

Bats were normally found to live in caves and trees. But the seafood market is in a densely-populated district of Wuhan, a metropolitan of ~15 million people. The probability was very low for the bats to fly to the market. According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors, the bat was never a food source in the city, and no bat was traded in the market. There was possible natural recombination or intermediate host of the coronavirus, yet little proof has been reported.</p></blockquote><p>Earlier, Dr. Xiao asserted that SARS-CoV-2 is "86 to 96 percent" similar to the already known Bat-CoV-ZC45 virus, and uses this to claim that SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in bats.

Yunnan provice is nearly 1,100 miles away from Wuhan, according to Google Maps. As Dr. Botao Xiao correctly stated, it would be unlikely for any bats to be living naturally in Wuhan, as it is a metropolis district that is avoided by most wildlife. Additionally, most bat species would be in hibernation around the time of outbreak.</p><p>One possible explanation would be that a farmer or laborer in Yunnan went into this cave (for example, to collect bat feces known as "guano" which is apparently used for agricultural reasons), and then travelled to Wuhan later after being infected. However, if this is the case, it is unlikely that the outbreak would have reached epidemic levels in Wuhan first. Consider that, again according to Google Maps, a trip from Yunnan to Wuhan would take over a day:</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><img src="map-3.png" alt="" width="800" height="384"/></p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Wuhan,+Hubei,+China/Yunnan,+China/@27.404319,103.3009215"><span class="url">https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Wuhan,+Hubei,+China/Yunnan,+China/@27.404319,103.3009215</span></a></p></blockquote><p>If Patient Zero had taken a bus or other form of public transport, SARS-CoV-2 would have begun spreading along that route, not in Wuhan. It would be fairly easy for Chinese authorities to determine a mutual connection amongst original cases by simply asking them if they had travelled recently and if so, what bus, train, or flight they took. Consider that this type of "contact tracing" was already used to determine that the Huanan Seafood Market was the original source of the outbreak (at least, according to Chinese state media).</p><p>Even if Patient Zero had driven him or herself to Wuhan, they most likely would have stopped along the way for bathroom and food breaks. Again, they would have spread the virus at whatever rest stop they went to. However, if this happened, it has not been reported.</p><p>If the outbreak indeed started from the Huanan Seafood Market, that means an animal at the market would have had to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, there were no bats sold at the Huanan Seafood Market: <a href="#%28part._no-bats%29" data-pltdoc="x">There Are Few Bats in Wuhan</a>. This means that a spillover event, from a bat to some other intermediary animal, could not have occured at the Huanan Seafood Market. The intermediary animal would have had to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 before it arrived at the market.</p><p>The Huanan Seafood Market is known as a "wet" market, in which animal carcasses are sold rather than individual animal parts (i.e. you would buy a dead pig but not packaged pork). This means that the animal was almost certainly not safely packaged at the time of purchase or at the time it arrived at the market.</p><p>Consider the amount of people any type of meat encounters before finally reaching its consumer. First, the animal must be hunted before being sent to a market (wouldn&rsquo;t the hunter be Patient Zero? Surely China would be able to look at its medical records to find hunters who died of unknown causes at the beginning of the outbreak). Depending on where the animal was first killed, this trip could take days and involve multiple modes of transportation, such as an airplane, bus, truck, train, or car. In every case but one (car) the animal would be inserted into the vehicle by employees at an airport, bus station, train station, or warehouse loading ramp. In every case but one, these are typically locations that have very high levels of foot traffic. If transporting the animal took multiple trips, this means that multiple employees at each location would have been exposed to the infected animal before it was finally placed on sale at the Huanan Seafood Market. We assert that it is highly unlikely anyone would drive a car filled with animal carcasses. Consider the stench.</p><p>Where are the sick employees who handled this infected animal? Where are the localized epidemics caused by these employees? What are the odds that every single one of them did not get sick until the animal reached the Huanan Seafood Market?</p><p>And, let&rsquo;s also not take for granted, that in order for this animal to even get infected with SARS-CoV-2, it itself would have had to be involved in a spillover event with a bat. Remember that bats were hibernating during this time period.</p><p>In order for this pandemic to have originated outside of a Wuhan biological laboratory, the following would have had to take place:</p><ul><li><p>An unknown animal comes into contact with a bat carrying the virus that would become SARS-CoV-2. This bat, for some reason, is not hibernating during the winter unlike most other bats.</p></li><li><p>This animal is then hunted and killed by some unknown person who does not fall ill and does not spread SARS-CoV-2 to anyone else.</p></li><li><p>This animal is then sent from its original location to the Huanan Seafood Market. Along the way, it is handled by dozens to hundreds of transportation employees, all of whom do not get sick and do not spread the virus.</p></li><li><p>The animal finally reaches the market, at which point multiple people who encounter it are hospitalized, and the virus begins to spread at very high rates.</p></li></ul><p>Perhaps this virus had been spreading undetected amongst animal populations for the past few months prior to the outbreak. But if this is the case, why would the spillover event to a human occur in Huanan Seafood Market? China has many hundreds of these markets in every province. We are looking at 1-in-several-thousand-odds that a natural outbreak would begin in this market versus all the others.</p><p>Consider the odds we are looking at of a natural outbreak occuring in a market less than 10 miles away from two labs which have previously housed bats and conducted research on bat coronaviruses, rather than any other market in China.</p><p>Four months into the outbreak, China, with its vast electronic surveillance network and army of CCTV cameras, <span style="font-style: italic">still</span> has not been able to provide any evidence that this virus originated anywhere other than the market in Wuhan.</p><p>We argue that it would be incredibly unlikely for a virus to materialize out of thin air in this particular market.</p><h3>9<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Claim_2__.Did_.S.A.R.S-.Co.V-2_.Begin_.From_an_.Infected_.Lab_.Worker_or_.Animal_in_.Wuhan_)"></a>Claim 2: Did SARS-CoV-2 Begin From an Infected Lab Worker or Animal in Wuhan?</h3><p>We will begin this claim by first acknowledging that, obviously, the answer to this question remains unknown as of now. However, it is appropriate to collect and highlight all evidence that may support this theory, and evidence that may disprove it.</p><p>In Claim 1, we proved that it is highly probable that SARS-CoV-2 could have been present in the WIV or the WHCDC - either as samples in a lab, or in live animals held in cages. In either situation, a single accident could result in exposure ("Laboratory-Acquired Infection") to a human being that would become Patient Zero of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we will provide evidence that such accidental exposure is also highly probable.</p><h4>9.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Hypothetical_.Spillover_.Events)"></a>Hypothetical Spillover Events</h4><p>We claim that a spillover event involving these labs could have occured in one of several ways:</p><ul><li><p>A researcher working in a BSL-2, BSL-3, or BSL-4 lab could have been exposed to the pathogen while performing an experiment. Because SARS-CoV-2 has an incubation period between several days and several weeks, and because infected people can spread it asymptomatically, a researcher who is infected would not know they are infected until symptoms appear, possibly hundreds of hours later. This is sufficient time for them to spread the virus to others if they do not self quarantine.</p></li><li><p>Lab animals involved in experiments could have been improperly disposed of or even illegally sold to markets. Whoever comes into contact with infected tissue would be at risk of infection, for example if they touch the animal and then touch their face, or even eat the animal.</p></li><li><p>An infected lab animal could have bitten or otherwise exposed a researcher to SARS-CoV-2, and they could either have not quarantined at all or quarantined for too little time (i.e. they would still be contagious past the quarantine period).</p></li></ul><p>We will prove in this claim that evidence exists to support all three possibilities.</p><h4>9.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Bio-.Laboratory_.Accidents_.Are_.Not_.Impossible)"></a>Bio-Laboratory Accidents Are Not Impossible</h4><p>There are many factual, peer reviewed accounts of biolab accidents.

Our rules required that animals targeted for injection be strapped to a wooden board to hold them securely in place. That day, Ustinov wasn&rsquo;t following procedure. He decided to steady the guinea pigs with his gloved hand. Perhaps he thought it would help calm them. Or perhaps he was in too much of a hurry.
The technician became distracted and nudged him accidentally. Ustinov&rsquo;s hand slipped just as he was pressing down on the syringe. The needle went through the guinea pig and punctured his thumb, drawing blood.</p><p>Biohazard, pg. 128</p></blockquote><p>Ustinov was cared for until death by his wife, who was also a bioweaponeer at Koltsovo.

An estimate for intramural laboratories at the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases is that 2 exposures occur for every 100,000 operator-hours and that only 1 of 12 such exposures involved an actual human infection. Another set of data, lacking a denominator of operator-hours, registered 26 incidents with 8 documented infections in U.S. BSL-3 and -4 laboratories and 5 more, all resulting in infections, in BSL-3 and -4 laboratories abroad (10). Because reporting of laboratories&#8217; existence, size, and activities, as well as accidents, is all incomplete, it is difficult to obtain precise rates comparable to those of NIAID. Nonetheless, using plausible assumptions, Klotz and Sylvester (5) estimate a historical risk of an accidental laboratory escape of a potentially pandemic pathogen of 0.3% per laboratory per year.</p><p>While these figures may sound low, the key problem is that they increase as more laboratories undertake work on PPPs and as they do so over a longer period. Even at the NIAID, the intramural estimated rate of 2 exposures per 100,000 operator-hours, a remarkably low rate that likely reflects very careful practices, one would expect 1 out of every 50 technicians working half-time (1,000 h) in such a laboratory to be exposed each year and 1 of every 600 to become infected. Over a 10-year period, with 100 such laboratories each employing 5 such technicians, one would expect 100 exposures and about 8 infections.

The cables have fueled discussions inside the U.S. government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus &#8212; even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge.</p><p>In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which had in 2015 become China&#8217;s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). WIV issued a news release in English about the last of these visits, which occurred on March 27, 2018. The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss, the consul general in Wuhan, and Rick Switzer, the embassy&#8217;s counselor of environment, science, technology and health. <span style="font-weight: bold">Last week, WIV erased that statement from its website, though it remains archived on the Internet.</span></p><p>...</p><p>&#8220;During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,&#8221; states the Jan. 19, 2018, cable, which was drafted by two officials from the embassy&#8217;s environment, science and health sections who met with the WIV scientists. (The State Department declined to comment on this and other details of the story.)</p><p>...</p><p>As many have pointed out, there is no evidence that the virus now plaguing the world was engineered; scientists largely agree it came from animals. <span style="font-weight: bold">But that is not the same as saying it didn&#8217;t come from the lab, which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals</span>, said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley.</p><p>...</p><p>Sources familiar with the cables said they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns at the WIV lab, especially regarding its work with bat coronaviruses.

The cables began to circulate again inside the administration over the past two months as officials debated whether the lab could be the origin of the pandemic and what the implications would be for the U.S. pandemic response and relations with China.</p><p>...</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;The idea that it was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial.

As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted[7,11]. Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used[19]. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone[20].</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9"><span class="url">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9</span></a> (archive: <a href="https://archive.is/59vJY"><span class="url">https://archive.is/59vJY</span></a>)</p></blockquote><p>To start with, we will once again state that we are not claiming SARS-CoV-2 has been engineered.</p><p>That being said, Reference 20 is the paper <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930446">"Coronavirus reverse genetic systems: infectious clones and replicons"</a> that contains "several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses." However, this paper was published in 2014. The WIV&rsquo;s study (Paper 2) was published one year later, in 2015. From the paper:</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence (2015)</span></p><p>Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="refpara"><blockquote class="refcolumn"><blockquote class="refcontent"><p>We are looking for contributors that can help us verify if the 2014 paper "Coronavirus reverse genetic systems: infectious clones and replicons" mentions the "mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone" described in the 2015 WIV paper.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>While it should be relatively simple to prove whether this "mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone" was covered in the 2014 paper, all the WIV would have to do is to simply use a backbone that had not been published previously to invalidate this part of the paper. Indeed, without direct access to the lab it would be impossible to prove what backbones have been used in the past and are currently being used in ongoing studies.</p><p>Additionally, this paper does not address the "Infected Animal" theory, which is far more likely to have occured at the WHCDC. Indeed, the paper itself states:</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p>Although the evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus, <span style="font-weight: bold">it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here</span>. However, since we observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features, including the optimized RBD and polybasic cleavage site, in related coronaviruses in nature, we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.</p></blockquote><p>While the phrase "laboratory-based scenario" is abstract, given prior context, we will assume this again refers to the "Manipulated Virus" theory. It remains plausible for a lab animal to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, either prior to arriving at the lab or as part of a spillover event occuring in the lab, afterwards spreading the virus to human Patient Zero. From the layman&rsquo;s explanation of Paper 1 we remember that:</p><ul><li><p>Multiple coronaviruses can infect the same bat (coinfection)</p></li><li><p>Coronaviruses like to mix their genes together (recombinate)</p></li><li><p>If two coronaviruses infect the same bat and recombinate, they can potentially result in a novel (never before recognized) coronavirus</p></li><li><p>It only takes a few changes ("exchange of a relatively small sequence segment") between two coronaviruses to result in a third coronavirus that can infect other animals ("host-switching")</p></li><li><p>The odds of this happening are pretty good!</p></li></ul><p>Indeed, wouldn&rsquo;t it be far more likely for such a recombination event to occur in a laboratory housing many bats in close quarters, such as the WHCDC, rather than anywhere else in Wuhan?</p><p>While not directly related to our claim, we would also like to take a moment to point out what we believe to be ethical concerns regarding this paper:</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">YiSheng BioPharma Announces Research Collaboration With The Scripps Research Institute In Developing New AIDS Vaccine (November 7, 2016)</span></p><p>BEIJING and LA JOLLA, Calif., Nov. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ &ndash; Yisheng Biopharma Co., Ltd.

#SARSCoV2 is an outgrowth of circulating diversity of SARS-like viruses in bats. A zoonosis is expected to be a random draw from this diversity. A lab escape is highly likely to be a common lab strain, either exactly 2002 SARS or WIV1. 5/21</p></blockquote><p>As proved in Claim 1, WIV has engaged in gain-of-function research resulting in new strains of SARS-CoV-1, for example the synthetic SHC014-CoV. Furthermore, we also proved that the WHCDC housed bats and a researcher from the WHCDC had to quarantine twice due to accidental exposure.</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p>Note that previous non-zoonotic outbreaks have been obvious from genetic data, one example being the 1977 "Russian" flu, which was clearly a 1950s human virus that had been in a freezer for 20 years (https://mbio.asm.org/content/6/4/e01013-15). 6/21</p><p>Data point #2 (receptor binding domain):
This point is rather technical, please see preprint by @K_G_Andersen, @arambaut, et al at http://virological.org/t/the-proximal-origin-of-sars-cov-2/398 &#8230; for full details. 9/21</p><p>But, briefly, #SARSCoV2 has 6 mutations to its receptor binding domain that make it good at binding to ACE2 receptors from humans, non-human primates, ferrets, pigs, cats, pangolins (and others), but poor at binding to bat ACE2 receptors. 10/21</p><p>This pattern of mutation is most consistent with evolution in an animal intermediate, rather than lab escape. Additionally, the presence of these same 6 mutations in the pangolin virus argues strongly for an animal origin: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.945485v1 &#8230; 11/21</p></blockquote><p>It is indeed likely that we would have been able to tell if SARS-CoV-2 was genetically derived from any research the WIV has made public. Of course, we are unaware of any reseach they have not published. This also does not address an infected lab animal scenario. We argue that the virus could have easily originated in an animal in one of these labs.</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p>Data point #3 (market cases):
Many early infections in Wuhan were associated with the Huanan Seafood Market. A zoonosis fits with the presence of early cases in a large animal market selling diverse mammals. A lab escape is difficult to square with early market cases. 13/21</p></blockquote><p>As proven in Claim 1, at least several dozen cases had no association with the seafood market at all. Furthermore, what if an <a href="#%28part._animal-seller%29" data-pltdoc="x">infected lab animal had ended up being sold to the market</a>, as <a href="#%28part._weibo-message%29" data-pltdoc="x">Chen Quanjiao&rsquo;s Weibo Message</a> allegedly claimed?</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p>Data point #4 (environmental samples):
33 out of 585 environmental samples taken from the Huanan seafood market showed as #SARSCoV2 positive. 31 of these were collected from the western zone of the market, where wildlife booths are concentrated. 15/21
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/27/c_138735677.htm</p><p>Environmental samples could in general derive from human infections, but I don&rsquo;t see how you&rsquo;d get this clustering within the market if these were human derived. 16/21</p></blockquote><p>Again, this assumes that a researcher was Patient Zero, which is one possibility.
